# Agent Flow for Complete QA System Construction

## 🧠 Comprehensive End-to-End Automation Framework

This document outlines a systematic approach for AI agents to construct complete quality assessment systems from research goal to deployment, based on successful patterns and expanded to cover all experiment types.

---

## 📊 Experiment Type Classification

### **Category 1: Comparison Experiments**
```yaml
purpose: "Compare test conditions against baseline references"
structure: "Reference-Target pairs with systematic matching"
use_cases:
  - "TTS emotion scale effectiveness" (current TTS QA system)
  - "Audio compression quality vs uncompressed"
  - "Voice cloning similarity to original"
  - "UI design variants vs control"
  
statistical_approach: "Paired comparisons, effect sizes"
sample_complexity: "Medium (need reference + target for each condition)"
```

### **Category 2: Explorative Quality Assessment**
```yaml
purpose: "Discover quality issues, artifacts, or patterns across all variables"
structure: "Comprehensive variable coverage with random sampling"
use_cases:
  - "Detect TTS artifacts across all voice-emotion combinations"
  - "Find audio compression breaking points"
  - "Identify problematic UI element combinations"
  - "Quality assurance for new voice models"
  
statistical_approach: "Descriptive statistics, anomaly detection, clustering"
sample_complexity: "High (need broad coverage of variable space)"
```

### **Category 3: Ranking Experiments**
```yaml
purpose: "Order multiple options by preference or quality"
structure: "Present multiple samples simultaneously for ranking"
use_cases:
  - "Rank 5 TTS systems by naturalness"
  - "Order UI designs by user preference"
  - "Prioritize feature implementations"
  
statistical_approach: "Kendall's tau, rank correlation, pairwise comparison matrices"
sample_complexity: "Medium (fewer samples, more cognitive load per evaluation)"
```

### **Category 4: A/B Testing**
```yaml
purpose: "Choose between two specific options"
structure: "Binary choice with optional preference strength"
use_cases:
  - "Current TTS vs new model"
  - "UI layout A vs layout B"
  - "Feature enabled vs disabled"
  
statistical_approach: "Chi-square tests, binomial confidence intervals"
sample_complexity: "Low (simple binary comparisons)"
```

### **Category 5: Single Rating Assessment**
```yaml
purpose: "Evaluate individual samples on absolute scales"
structure: "Rate each sample independently on multiple dimensions"
use_cases:
  - "Rate TTS naturalness without comparison"
  - "Score UI usability independently"
  - "Assess content quality on multiple criteria"
  
statistical_approach: "ANOVA, regression analysis, reliability measures"
sample_complexity: "Medium (no reference needed, but need sufficient samples per condition)"
```

### **Category 6: Threshold Detection**
```yaml
purpose: "Find breaking points, limits, or optimal ranges"
structure: "Systematic parameter sweeps with quality degradation detection"
use_cases:
  - "Find emotion scale where quality breaks down"
  - "Detect compression bitrate threshold"
  - "Identify cognitive load limits"
  
statistical_approach: "Change point detection, regression discontinuity"
sample_complexity: "High (need dense sampling around potential thresholds)"
```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Example

### **TTS Emotion Scale Case - Agent Conversation**

**Agent**: What's your research goal?

**User**: "I need to decide which emotion scale ranges to offer users in our TTS product, specifically to find where emotional expression starts failing."

**Agent**: This sounds like a **Comparison Experiment** with **Threshold Detection** elements. You'll want reference-target pairs to compare emotional vs neutral versions, systematically testing different scale values to find breaking points.

**Template**: Comparison + Threshold Detection hybrid
- Reference: Neutral TTS (no emotion)  
- Targets: Same content with emotion at scales [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0]
- Focus: Identify scale thresholds where quality degrades

**User**: "Yes, but I also want to test this across different emotions and voices to catch any specific combinations that fail."

**Agent**: Perfect! This requires **comprehensive variable coverage**. Let me map your variables:

```yaml
primary_test_variable: emotion_scale [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0]
secondary_variables:
  - emotion_type: [label_based, vector_based] 
  - emotion_value: [angry, sad, happy, whisper, toneup, tonedown, excited, furious, terrified, fear, surprise, excitement]
  - voice_id: [v001, v002]
  - text_type: [match, neutral, opposite]
contextual_variables:
  - expressivity: [none, enhanced_0.6]

total_combinations: 2×12×3×6×2×2 = 1,728
```

**Statistical Analysis**: For threshold detection with this many variables, I recommend:
- **Sample**: 1,008 strategically selected combinations (covers all important patterns)
- **Per session**: 25 samples (prevents cognitive fatigue)
- **Expected power**: 85% to detect medium effect sizes
- **Confidence**: 90% sufficient for product decisions

**User**: "Sounds good. Now I need to generate all the audio samples."

**Agent**: I'll create a generation script. What's your TTS API?

**User**: "We use a custom API at dev.icepeak.ai with Bearer token authentication."

**Agent**: 
```python
# Generated TTS sample generation script
class IcepeakTTSGenerator:
    def __init__(self, api_token: str):
        self.api_token = api_token
        self.base_url = "https://dev.icepeak.ai/api"
        self.rate_limit = 4  # concurrent requests max
        
    async def generate_sample(self, voice_id: str, text: str, 
                            emotion: str, scale: float, 
                            emotion_type: str, expressivity: str):
        # Reference version (neutral)
        reference_request = {
            "text": text + ("|0.6" if expressivity == "0.6" else ""),
            "actor_id": voice_id,
            "style_label": "normal-1",  # Neutral baseline
            "emotion_scale": 1.0,
            # ... rest of config
        }
        
        # Target version (with emotion)
        target_request = {
            "text": text + ("|0.6" if expressivity == "0.6" else ""),
            "actor_id": voice_id,
            "style_label": "normal-1",
            f"{emotion_type}": emotion,
            "emotion_scale": scale,
            # ... rest of config  
        }
        # ... batch processing logic
```

**User**: "Great! For the database, can we use Supabase?"

**Agent**: 
```sql
-- Generated Supabase schema for TTS comparison experiment
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    voice_set VARCHAR, -- expressivity_none or expressivity_0.6
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    samples_data JSON
);

CREATE TABLE evaluations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id VARCHAR REFERENCES sessions(session_id),
    sample_id VARCHAR,
    scores JSON, -- {quality: 5, emotion: 6, similarity: 7}
    comment TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    duration_ms INTEGER
);
```

**User**: "Perfect! Let's deploy this."

**Agent**: 
```typescript
// Generated evaluation interface
// - Blue reference audio player (neutral baseline)
// - Orange target audio player (with emotion + scale)  
// - Shared text display above both players
// - 3-dimension evaluation form (quality, emotion, similarity)
// - Progress tracking and session management
// - Auto-save to Supabase
```

**Final Result**: Complete TTS QA system deployed at custom URL, ready for participant evaluation.
